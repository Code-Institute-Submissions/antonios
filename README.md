# Antonio's

[View the live project here.](https://mcbradderzz.github.io/antonios/)

## Description of the Project

* Antonio's is an existing business and I have a personal relationship with the owners.  I have previously worked at the restaurant for over five years and I am passionate about their values and want to promote their brand.  I have designed promotional flyers for special events in the past.

I made various repositories re-creating my project to get it perfect. I saved the code what worked and deleted the code that didn't which is why some of my commits are very close together.

## User Experience (UX)

### First Time User Goals

* I would like first time users to easily navigate through the website and find out what food Antonio's serves, who the owners are ie provenance and how easy it is to visit the restaurant.

### Returning User Goals

* I would like returning users to view the most up to date menus and remind themselves of what a great selection of food is available, what the opening times are and then call to make a booking.

### Frequently User Goals

* I would like frequent users to easily book a table or functions at Antonio's.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

* Primary Colour - Orange (#ffa000)
* White - (#fff)
* Light Grey - (#ddd)
* Dark Grey - (#222)
* Black - (#000)

* I wanted to incorporate the red and yellow colours of the Spanish flag, for this Spanish restaurant.  However, I found the colour red to be too aggressive and the colour yellow didn't have enough contrast. Therefore, I used a blend of both red and yellow.

### Imagery

* All of the imagery has tones of orange, red or yellow to go with the colour scheme of the website.

### Typography

* Alex Brush is a script style font. I used it for the logo as it represents a handwritten, personal touch to Antonio's which is one of his key, unique selling points.

* I chose the Poppins font to give the website a modern look which also contrasts the logo nicely - traditional yet modern. Poppins is a sans-serif style font which very popular with web developers.
