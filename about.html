            <div class="block-divider"></div>
            <p class="txt-justify">Antonio and Zara are the proprietors of Antonio’s restaurant in Fareham. Antonio bought the restaurant in December 2004 and has worked tirelessly to transform it into one of the most acclaimed Spanish restaurants in Hampshire. Between them, they have over 60 years of experience in hospitality.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="txt-justify">Originally from Galicia in northwestern Spain, Antonio started his career in hospitality at the age of 14 and went on to work in many high-class restaurants and hotels in Spain, acquiring both the knowledge and high standards that were expected in these establishments. He then moved to England when he was 20, where he worked in many restaurants in Reading, Newbury and Southampton, until purchasing Antonio’s in 2004.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="txt-justify">Zara started her career in hospitality at the age of 18, working part-time at Whitbread in The Cormorant pub, Portchester. She has held her Personal Licence since the age of 21. Her last pub was the Red Lion, Stubbington. She left the pub industry in December 2004. She met Antonio in 2005 and they married ten years later!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="txt-justify">Our philosophy is simple yet effective - we provide excellent food at sensible prices, and this combined with both our friendly and attentive service, make us one of the most enjoyable and successful restaurants in Hampshire.</p>
